### Tracking Progress
##### 1/27/2021:
* Initial commit. Making a React app starting with a simple search function to look up a summoner name and return some information about the summoner.
* **Issues**: API call is made on first render, but functionally everything is working. See [here](https://github.com/nagaturd/leagueplusplus/blob/ac7dd294f43a378933c0308fe6135a3abba63cfb/src/components/Search.js#L10-L12) for the problem code.
